Codes on reproducing results in this [paper].


Two reservoir models were studied:

1. [PUNQS3] Based on a field in North Sea with 6 producer wells
2. [Zagadka] Based on a field in Russia with more than 100 producer wells.


Three stochastic algorithms were compared:

1. [MOPSO]
2. [NSGA-II](../blob/master/Optimizer/nsga2)
3. [RVEA]
